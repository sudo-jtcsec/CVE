SUMMARY: https://james-clee.com/2020/04/18/multiple-wavlink-vulnerabilities/

 [Suggested description]
An issue was discovered on Wavlink WL-WN579G3 M79X3.V5030.180719,
WL-WN575A3 RPT75A3.V4300.180801, and WL-WN530HG4 M30HG4.V5030.191116
devices. A crafted POST request can be sent to adm.cgi that will
result in the execution of the supplied command if there is an active
session at the same time. The POST request itself is not validated to
ensure it came from the active session.

[Additional Information]
Three different information disclosure vulnerabilities outlined in CVE-2020-10972, 
CVE-2020-10973, and CVE-2020-10974 allow you to get the administrator password and 
thus create your own session instead of relying on an end user to be authenticated 
at that time.
