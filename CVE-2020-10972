SUMMARY: https://james-clee.com/2020/04/18/multiple-wavlink-vulnerabilities/

[Suggested description]
An issue was discovered on Wavlink WL-WN530HG4 M30HG4.V5030.191116
devices. A page is exposed that has the current administrator password
in cleartext in the source code of the page. No authentication is
required in order to reach the page (live_********.shtml with the variable
syspasswd).

------------------------------------------

[Additional Information]
This can be used in conjunction with CVE-2020-10971 for
WL-WN530HG4 to achieve full remote code execution,
since you can use the administrator password found here to create your
own session instead of relying on the end user.
