SUMMARY: https://james-clee.com/2020/04/23/more-information-disclosure-in-wavlink-devices/

[Suggested description]
An issue was discovered on Wavlink WL-WN530HG4 M30HG4.V5030.191116
devices, affecting /cgi-bin/ExportALLSettings.sh. A crafted POST
request returns the current configuration of the device encrypted 
with OpenSSL aes-256-cbc without requiring any sort of authentication. However, the password to encrypt/decrypt 
the file is hardcoded. Once the file is decrypted with the hardcoded 
key, it contains the administrator username and password.

------------------------------------------

[Additional Information]
This can be used in conjunction with CVE-2020-10973 to achieve full 
remote code execution, since you can use the administrator password 
found here to create your own session instead of relying on the end user.
